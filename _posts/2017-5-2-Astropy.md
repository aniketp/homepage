In around mid January, Programming Club organised a workshop on the following topics-
* Open-Source
* Version Control 
* Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
* Mailing list

When I got notified about the workshop, I was reluctant to attend it. I had been delving deep into front end development
 during that time. And being a noob programmer, I thought maybe it was a bit too much for me to focus on multiple domains
  of programming. But that innate curiosity within me was craving to find out what exactly those alien terminologies meant.
   After much introspection, I finally decided to attend the workshop. Even though I promised myself not to get distracted
    into these things. Little did I know how terribly wrong I was. And how my life would change completely!! (in a positive sense) 

### GSoC is here

At the workshop, our two coordinators, Saksham and Pallav, introduced us to this overwhelming world of 
Open-Source development. They explained that the four terms mentioned above are all a significant part of Open source.
 IRC is a primitive looking messaging client which is heavily used by developer community these days. Most of us were
  already familiar with Github so it wasn't much difficult to understand how Version control worked. We also got to know
   some ways in which we can contribute to those projects. Mostly by looking for issues with the following tags `newbie`,
    `easy`, `package-novice`etc.

What the coordies actually wanted was to introduce us to a worldwide annual open-source competition held in summers.
 Popularly known as **Google Summer of Code**. As it is obvious in the name itself, GSoC was organised by Google. Though
  the interesting part, we're not supposed to work for Google if selected, rather any organisation/project we find interesting. 

### First PR Challenge

Just to get us started, the club presented us with this challenge that if someone's PR gets accepted in a good enough open source project
 (with over 200 stars), they will be given this T-shirt.

The moment I saw it, I made up my mind. Even though I did not have any interest in open-source, just because of the
 t-shirt I decided to start looking for easy bugs on github. However that night I tried a lot but could not find any bug
  I could fix.
  
I did not give up however, after about a month I submitted my first legitimate Pull Request. Actually, I had been reading 
<i>Automate Boring Stuff with Python</i> by <i>A. Sweigart</i>. The book contained a lot of cool python scripts through
 which you could automate various tasks. In one of the scripts, Sweigart used a python module called <code>pyperclip</code> 
 which he had written himself. There was a broken link in the shell script of the module, which I noticed while working 
 on the code. I managed to gather up enough courage and corrected the link. He turned out to be a nice guy. 
 Merged the PR the very next day <i class="em em-blush"></i>. Overwhelmed with joy, I sent the link of PR to Pallav as
  soon as I could, in a hope to get my hands on one of the T-shirt. 
  
Unfortunately, it was not to be. I was informed that I had to contribute to code in order to get the T-shirt. I had only
 fixed the link, which apparently wasn't under the terms of conditions. Though I was dejected, I did not give up. 
 I kept studying python in a hope to be able to contribute to code someday.

Little did I know, that a month later I would score my prize with a bang!
