I recently completed my second semester, so I thought this would be the best time to share my experience about my open source endeavour. I hope this blog will be of some use to those of you who want to set foot in this intricate world of Open Source. Also, I'll write a few separate blogs to explain about contribution ethics in open-source and getting familiarised with Git.

I first heard about open source when I started using Git (and Github).Eventually I did realize that coming across open source was inevitable once you get hold of the basics of Git. 

What is Git by the way? In layman's terms, Git is a tool through which you can keep track of your progress (changes) in your project. For example, have you ever come across this situation?
* Final.txt
* Final1.txt
* Final_confirm.txt
* Final\_this\_time\_completely\_sure.txt :D

Looks hilarious right? :smile: Well, you can make it look better using Git. _Git is a Version Control System (VCS), which keeps track of your changes that you've made to your project as you keep working on it_. It is also advantageous in situations where multiple people are working on a project.

Say you and your friend are working on a coding assignment. Suppose after a tedious amount of hardwork, you fixed a bug which was bothering you for days. You surely feel happy about your achievement (well you should be :simple\_smile:). But the next day, you wake up to find that the code is failing every single test case. Then your friend calls you and apologizes for the mess he made overnight. Now you're feeling frustated, cause you'll have to do it all again. 

But this situation could have been avoided, had you been using Git on your project. What Git does is that it saves every change you made to your code so that whenever you feel like you've messed up, you can go back to the part you think is correct. Else you will have no choice but to revamp your code.

So how exactly is Git used in Open source? Well, in the example of you and your friend working on a code, there probably might not be any major issues that you couldn't sort out. Two people can have enough coordination so as not to mess things up. But what if there are 10,000 people working on a software? You can imagine the kind of mess that would be created if the changes are not monitered regularly. So Git forms an essential component of software development. It is the reason why we're able to use so many softwares without encountering a bug every minute. :stuck\_out\_tongue\_winking\_eye:
