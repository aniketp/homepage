I recently completed my second semester, so I thought this will be the best time to share my experience about my open source endeavour. I hope this blog will be of some use to those of you who want to set foot in this intricate world of Open Source.

I first heard about open source when started using Git (and Github). Later only I found out that open source was inevitable once you get hold of the basics of Git. What is Git by the way? In layman's terms, Git is a tool through which you can keep track of your progress (changes) in your project. For example, have you ever come across this situation?
* Final.txt
* Final1.txt
* Final_confirm.txt
* Final\_this\_time\_completely\_sure.txt :D

Looks hilarious right? Well, you can make it look better using Git. It is a Version Control System (VCS), which keeps track of your changes that you've made to your file as you keep working on your file. It is also advantageous in situations where more than person are working on a project. Say you and your friend are working on a coding assignment. Suppose after a tedious amount of hardwork, you fixed a bug which was annoying you for days. You surely feel happy about your achievement (well you should be :)). But the next day, you wake up to find that the code is crashing in every single case. Now your friend calls you and apologizes for the mess he made overnight. Now you're feeling frustated, cause you'll have to do it all again. 

But this situation could have been avoided, had you been using Git on your project. What Git does is that it saves every change you made to your code/report so that whenever you feel like you've messed up, you can go back to the part you think is correct. Else you would have had no choice but to revamp your code.
