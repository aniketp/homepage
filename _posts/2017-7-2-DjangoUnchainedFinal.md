Finally after 7 weeks of reckless coding, our project is finished. I am writing this on the day we finally decided to 
conclude our project and inform the mentors to make certain changes and deploy it. With *779 commits* on GitHub 
 repository and more than *4000 lines of code*, the Nomination Portal comes to life.
 
### The UI Designing

I love front-end development. It is the only reason I started exploring other fields in programming. And I think I mentioned
this in one of my previous blogs. 

By the time we had almost finished most of the backend functionality, we thought a step ahead and decided rather than waiting
for a heads-up from the mentors about the backend features, we should start creating the User Interface. 

I took the responsibility of creating the base template. And since it was clearly instructed that the interface should be 
responsive and should work on all devices, we had no other option but to use Bootstrap. You would be thinking why am I upset
with Bootstrap. 
Well, to be honest, Bootstrap is great. It lets you create responsive UIs quickly. The only letdown is that 
I would not be able to write a custom CSS. Cause fixing margins and text-padding is out of option.  

After going through all the templates available at _bootswatch_, I chose a theme called **Cerulean**. It had this nice 
sky-blue navigation bar
