### What the hell is Linux
Being a hardcore gamer , I had no interest in anything other than Windows. I did appreciate MacOS for the versatility it offered, although I had no intention of getting it anytime soon. Nor was I even aware about other operating systems or for the record, what would I gain from switching over to them.

It was not until I came back to campus for the start of my second semester, I heard about Linux. I randomly asked a wingy of mine, Vardhan (also known as Dude!) about how he did his awesome techie stuff while he sat in front of his laptop whole day, completely engrossed in it. He said he had lately installed this OS called *Ubuntu 16.04* , a very famous distro of Linux in his Laptop. He went on explaining the awesome features that it offered, and how it was completely customisable and that you get to be the 'Superuser' of your machine. 

Interested, me and my close friend Ashish decided to give it a shot, for both of us wanted to do some real stuff in programming. But the problem occured when his laptop initially had some compatibility issues with Linux, apparently his Windows 7 armed HP laptop wasn't interested in sharing space with some other OS. Also we had no idea how to access and work with BIOS, disabling the Secure Boot feature , then there as a problem of getting a bootable USB. 

Faced with multiple problems, we approached Vardhan but for some reasons, he was unable to sort out our problems. So with no other option, we decided to drop the idea of installing Ubuntu... Maybe some other time...

### Linux install fest
Fortunately for us, the Programming Club of our Institute was planning to organise a small fest for installing Linux in our laptops, probably for those of us who couldn't figure out a way to install it. They gave us the option of installing either *Ubuntu LTS*, *Debian OS*, *Linux Mint* or *Arch Linux*. With the beginners being recommended to go with Ubuntu, as it would be easier to get accustomed to Linux that way.

I was already in contact with Saksham Sharma, one of the coordinators of PClub. According to his resume he already had experience with 4-5 Linux distros!! So I talked to him about various distros and which one I should prefer. He ofcourse recommended Ubuntu and also suggested me to go for multiple Linux distros once I'm familiar with various packages and utilities of Ubuntu.

### Problem with WiFi connectivity
I was not aware about this but apparently HP laptops had some ancient trouble with accepting Ubuntu dual-booting. Like seriously, after I successfully installed Ubuntu, my laptop started showing problem.

First, it showed some weird broken packages and I had no idea how to fix them, then all hells broke loose when it refused to connect to wifi. I asked a senior of mine and he asked me probably my wifi driver was inactive. So for that , he suggested me to install some packages related to **Broadcom Corporation BCM43142 802.11b/g/n**. Finally after two odd days , I was able to access wifi signals but even then, my laptop wasn't able to create a wifi hotspot. I tried everything I could but it didn't work. Finally I gave up on that issue and I still struggle to get any hotspot through my laptop. :(

### When wonders start to happen
What followed initial hiccup what an awesome experience I'd never forget. Today I feel much happier about my decision to install Linux, which surely changed my life. Now when I'm programming , I don't have to even touch my mousepad, I also don't have any headache of deciding which IDEs to download for which language. Its all in there. 

And who doesn't love Terminal, No I'm not talking about the hacker feel that it gives you (surely that's a cool thing too), but everything is so much better once you get a feel of various commands. Wanna install an app? Cool, do it from the terminal. Wanna compile your code? You have the terminal. Wanna launch an IDE? Fire up terminal. 

>It's been two months since I installed Linux. And I would admit, initial learning curve for Linux is pretty steep, but you need patience and need to keep using it, cause its benefits are indispensable and the fruits are sweet :) 

### Triple Booting!!!
After getting well accustomed to the environment of Linux and after many rounds of installing/uninstalling Ubuntu, I thought of going a step forward, installing another distro of linux alongside Ubuntu and Windows 10. However , I was reluctant to do so as the procedure seemed a bit nasty. And I was afraid if I mess up anything that could potentially destroy my laptop. But I had the guidance of my seniors, with their help, I finally installed *Linux Mint 18.1 'Serena'* as an alternative to Ubuntu.

Contrary to my belief of Mint overwriting the Ubuntu's Grub, it actually showed all three OS's at one place. So thankfully,I didn't have to update the grub. Also , Mint does seem to be a better option than Ubuntu (personal opinion), as it has more customisable options. Background theme options are cooler. And I'm actually writing this blog from Mint's text editor, which is also awesome.


So this more or less sums up my short adventure with Linux, I'll continue using Mint as of now and see if it actually is better than Ubuntu in a long run. :)
