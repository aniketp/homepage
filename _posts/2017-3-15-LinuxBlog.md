### What the hell is Linux
Being a hardcore gamer , I had no interest in anything other than Windows. I did appreciate MacOS for the versatility it offered, although I had no intention of getting it anytime soon. Nor was I even aware about other operating systems or for the record, what would I gain from switching over to them.</br>

It was not until I came back to campus for the start of my second semester, I heard about Linux. I randomly asked a wingy of mine, Vardhan (also known as Dude!) about how he did his awesome techie stuff while he sat in front of his laptop whole day, completely engrossed in it. He said he had lately installed this OS called *Ubuntu 16.04* , a very famous distro of Linux in his Laptop. He went on explaining the awesome features that it offered, and how it was completely customisable and that you get to be the 'Superuser' of your machine. 

Interested, me and my close friend Ashish decided to give it a shot, for both of us wanted to do some real stuff in programming. But the problem occured when his laptop initially had some compatibility issues with Linux, apparently his Windows 7 armed HP laptop wasn't interested in sharing space with some other OS. Also we had no idea how to access and work with BIOS, disabling the Secure Boot feature , then there as a problem of getting a bootable USB. 

Faced with multiple problems, we approached Vardhan but for some reasons, he was unable to sort out our problems. So with no other option, we decided to drop the idea of installing Ubuntu... Maybe some other time...

### Linux install fest
Fortunately for us, the Programming Club of our Institute was planning to organise a small fest for installing Linux in our laptops, probably for those of us who couldn't figure out a way to install it. They gave us the option of installing *Ubuntu LTS*, *Debian OS*, *Linux Mint* or *Arch Linux*. With the beginners being recommended to go with Ubuntu, as it would be easier to get accustomed to Linux that way.

I was already in contact with Saksham Sharma, one of the coordinators of PClub. According to his resume he already had experience with 4-5 Linux distros!! So I talked to him about various distros and which one I should prefer. He of-course recommended Ubuntu and also suggested me to go for multiple Linux distros once I'm familiar with various packages and utilities of Ubuntu.

### Problem with WiFi connectivity
I was not aware about this but apparently HP laptops had some ancient trouble with accepting Ubuntu dual-booting. Like seriously, after I successfully installed Ubuntu in my laptop started showing problem.

First, it showed some weird broken packages and I had no idea how to fix them, then all hells broke loose when it refused to connect to wifi. I asked a senior of mine and he asked me probably my wifi driver was inactive. So for that , he suggested me to install some packages related to **Broadcom Corporation BCM43142 802.11b/g/n**.
