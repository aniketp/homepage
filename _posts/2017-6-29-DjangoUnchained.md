I got a project under Programming club in summers that turned out to be a great experience in creating a scalable web application in **Django**.
My project partner, Ashish and me started off by building a basic library portal through which it is possible to add users,
authenticate their account, and allow them to borrow books online. 

It does sound cool but it really is very frustrating if you try is by your own the very first time. Our mentor Pratham asked us to 
create this library so that we can be fairly comfortable while starting the main project. I searched for some tutorials on 
Django on the internet, and found one by MDN which coincidentally, was also focused on staring out with a library. 

### Writing my first server

I tried following that tutorial but somewhere in between I got distracted and couldn't complete the portal. I assumed I'll have enough
time to completely grasp the concepts and then work on our main project. But when I came back to campus in mid-May to start off 
the camp, I realized I should've given more time to learning basics as Ashish had already created his portal which looked 
stunning and it already had all the features that Pratham asked us to include.

With no option left, I pulled two all-nighters and tried reading the source code Ashish had written. Though it was tough initially,
I finally started understanding how things worked in Django.

### What is Django

Django is a web-framework written in Python which allows us to create dynamic and scalable web application through which, it is 
easy to manage users of various permissions. Also, Django being in Python makes it more intuitive and easy to understand. I had already 
done a lot of programming in Python while preparing for GSoC (in this blog). So picking up new concepts wasn't that hard.

There are three main components in Django

* Models
* Views
* URLs
